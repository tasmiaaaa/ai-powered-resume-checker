# AI Powered Resume Checker
# 1. Introduction 
In today's competitive job market, having a well-crafted resume is crucial. However, many job seekers struggle with resume formatting, grammar, keyword optimization, and compatibility with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). To address these challenges, we propose the AI-Based Resume Checker - a smart, web-based platform that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI to analyze resumes and provide constructive, real-time feedback.
