# AI Powered Resume Checker
# 1. Introduction 
In today's competitive job market, having a well-crafted resume is crucial. However, many job seekers struggle with resume formatting, grammar, keyword optimization, and compatibility with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). To address these challenges, we propose the AI-Based Resume Checker - a smart, web-based platform that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI to analyze resumes and provide constructive, real-time feedback. The system extracts and evaluates key information from resumes and suggests improvements to help users craft more effective job applications.


# 2. Problem Statement & Motivation
Most resumes are either poorly optimized or not tailored for specific job descriptions, resulting in low interview selection rates. Recruiters often rely on ATS to filter resumes, which can reject well-qualified candidates due to formatting issues or missing keywords. Our platform aims to:- Automate resume evaluation and provide AI-generated feedback. Increase the success rate of job applications. Help users align their resumes with job descriptions. Reduce recruiter workload by standardizing resume analysis. 


# 3. Objectives-
Develop a responsive web-based AI-powered resume evaluation tool. Extract and analyze resume content (skills, education, experience). Match resumes with job descriptions using NLP techniques. Provide grammar, formatting, and keyword optimization feedback. Generate downloadable reports and resume score breakdowns.
